
# Driver Compatibility

Driver schemas are auto-generated from the VideoIPath API's JSON schema, enabling IntelliSense support during development and runtime validation of custom settings.

By default, the system uses the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version, currently 2024.4.12.

To switch to a different version after installation, run:

`set-videoipath-version <version>`

For example:

`set-videoipath-version 2024.3.3`

If no version is specified, the latest available LTS version is automatically used.
